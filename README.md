# How to actually get to the pack:
## Important Note: Only versions 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, and 1.18 are supported and actually have files in the branches, your GitHub is not broken and this is not a bug.

Find the version you are looking for, and from there follow the instructions below:

## If the .zip file does not show up when put in your minecraft/resourcepacks folder:

Unzip the file using any program like Winrar, 7zip, or Archive Utility. Sometimes GitHub has a bug where the folder that is created when decompressed has a second folder within it, breaking the structure. To solve this, simply drag the second folder inside the decompressed one into your resourcepacks folder. Sorry for the inconvenience.
