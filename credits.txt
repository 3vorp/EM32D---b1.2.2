Vattic - The founder and creator of the original Faithful 32x32 pack for Minecraft 1.8, which is the entire inspiration for this pack. Without him, this pack would have never existed, and by extension the entirety of Classic Faithful and even the broader Faithful community itself. Go show him some support over at https://www.gofundme.com/f/vattic-appreciation-fund, he really deserves it.
